## building the environment

What do we want, we want a basic typescript and react combination, built from scratch for learning purposes. This is main goal actually learning the ropes, not copy paste component and changeing some of it. 

- __package manager__ going with npm, we can switch to yarn later, the performance improvements wont help in the first place.
